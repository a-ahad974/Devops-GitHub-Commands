# Devops-GitHub-Commands

GitHub is a platform that allows users to host their projects and manage versions using Git, a version control system. Git allows for multiple versions of a project to be tracked and stored, making it easy to revert to a previous version if needed. Additionally, Git can be used without the command line, as some clients provide an understanding of the actions performed in the background. Here, I have discussed some of the fundamental and crucial GitHub commands to help you get started.

# git clone
This command allows you to clone an existing repository from GitHub to your local machine.

# git init
This command initializes a new repository on your local machine.

# git add
This command stages changes to be committed to the repository.

# git commit
This command saves changes to the repository with a descriptive message.

# git push
This command uploads local changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

# git pull
This command downloads changes from the remote repository on GitHub to your local machine.


# git rm: 

This command is used to remove files from a Git repository. It can be used in two ways:

git rm <file>: This command removes the specified file from the repository. The file will not be recoverable.

git rm --cached <file>: This command removes the file from the repository's index, but leaves the file in your local working directory.

# git remote:

This command is used to manage remote repositories in Git. It can be used in several ways:

git remote -v: This command displays a list of all remote repositories associated with the current local repository.

git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>: This command adds a new remote repository to the local repository.

git remote rm <remote_name>: This command removes an existing remote repository from the local repository.

git remote rename <old_remote_name> <new_remote_name>: This command renames an existing remote repository.

# git branch
This command allows you to create, delete, and manage branches within your repository.

# git merge
This command merges changes from one branch into another.

# git checkout
This command allows you to switch between different branches within your repository.

# git stash
This command allows you to temporarily store changes that are not ready to be committed
